\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
In this project, all centrality algorithms were implemented in Python using an adjacency--list representation of the graph. This choice provides efficient neighbourhood scans for sparse graphs, which are frequently necessary for centrality analysis.

\paragraph{Data Structures.}
Each algorithm operates on a dictionary-based adjacency list:
\[
\texttt{graph} : V \to \text{list of neighbors}.
\]

For intermediate computation, the following structures were used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Degree and harmonic closeness}: dictionaries storing numeric scores, one entry per vertex.
    \item \textbf{Brandes' betweenness}: arrays (Python dictionaries) for \texttt{dist}, \texttt{sigma}, \texttt{Pred}, and \texttt{delta}, matching the canonical Brandes formulation.
    \item \textbf{PageRank}: two rank vectors represented as dictionaries (\texttt{rank} and \texttt{new\_rank}) and an \texttt{outdeg} dictionary to precompute out-degrees.
\end{itemize}
